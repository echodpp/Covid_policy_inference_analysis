# Evaluating the Effect of COVID Lockdown Orders on Death and Case Rates

## Project Description

The aim of this final project is to evaluate the effect of COVID lockdown orders on death and case rates during the first wave of COVID. Specifically, we will be conducting a difference in difference analysis to determine the treatment effect on the following states:

- Minnesota
- Montana
- Nevada
- North Carolina
- Rhode Island
- Alabama
- Arizona
- Florida
- Georgia
- Kansas
- Maine
- Maryland
- Mississippi
- Missouri
- New Hampshire
- South Carolina
- Tennessee
- Texas
- Utah
- Virginia

The control group will consist of the following states:

- Arkansas
- Iowa
- Nebraska
- North Dakota
- Oklahoma
- South Dakota
- Wyoming

## Data Sources
The data used in this project will be sourced from reputable and reliable databases, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state government websites, and the New York Times. We will be collecting data on COVID cases and deaths from the beginning of the pandemic until the end of the first wave, which is defined as ending in early September, 2020. We will also collect data on lockdown orders and their dates of implementation for each state.

## Analysis Methodology
The main analytical method we will be using is the difference in difference analysis. This method compares the difference in outcomes (COVID cases and deaths) between the treatment and control groups, both before and after the treatment (lockdown orders) was implemented. This allows us to estimate the causal effect of the treatment, while controlling for other factors that may affect the outcome. We will also be conducting statistical tests to ensure the validity of our results.

## Expected Outcomes
We expect to find a significant reduction in COVID cases and deaths in the treatment group following the implementation of lockdown orders. This would suggest that lockdown orders were effective in reducing the spread of COVID during the first wave of the pandemic. We also expect to find minimal to no change in COVID cases and deaths in the control group, as they did not receive the treatment.

## Limitations
There are several limitations to this study that should be noted. Firstly, we will only be examining the first wave of COVID, and our findings may not be applicable to subsequent waves. Additionally, there may be other confounding factors that could affect our results, such as differences in population density, demographics, and healthcare resources.
